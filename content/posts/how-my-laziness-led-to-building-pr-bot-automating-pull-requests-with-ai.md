"Laziness is the mother of invention." — someone probably said that, and I wholeheartedly agree.

## The Lazy Developer's Dilemma

As a developer, I've always sought ways to minimize repetitive tasks. Not out of disgust for work, but because I believe in working smarter, not harder. One task that consistently disrupted my flow was creating pull requests (PRs). The process felt like a chore: selecting commits, writing descriptions, ensuring all checks passed, and finally, creating the PR. It was a series of steps that, while necessary, pulled me away from the creative aspects of coding.

## Observing the Pain Points

I wasn't alone in this sentiment. Conversations with fellow developers revealed a shared frustration. Many admitted to delaying PRs, leading to bottlenecks in the development cycle. The manual nature of the process was a common gripe. It became clear that this was a widespread issue begging for a solution.

## The Eureka Moment

One evening, after yet another tedious PR creation, I thought, "What if I could automate this?" That question sparked the idea for PR-bot. I envisioned a tool that could:

- Allow interactive selection of commits
- Generate PR descriptions using AI
- Create PRs directly from the terminal

The goal was to streamline the process, making it efficient and less disruptive.

## Building PR-bot

Turning the idea into reality wasn't just about writing code — it was about solving a deeply familiar pain. I wanted PR-bot to feel like an extension of a developer's natural workflow: minimal fuss, maximum impact.

The first challenge was commit selection. I've often found myself squinting at Git logs, trying to remember what I changed and why. So I built an interactive interface that lets you cherry-pick commits straight from the terminal. No need to copy-paste hashes or second-guess your choices — just a clean, focused experience that respects your time.

Next came the descriptions. Ah, the dreaded PR description — how many of us write "minor fix" when it's clearly not? I knew this part needed help. So I wired up AI — OpenAI's GPT and Gemini support out of the box, and even local models like LM Studio. PR-bot looks at your commits and drafts a clear, structured PR summary, so you can spend more time thinking and less time typing.

Finally, I didn't want to break out of the flow to open a browser or fiddle with GitHub manually. Using GitHub's CLI, PR-bot lets you create pull requests from start to finish without ever leaving your terminal window. It's automation without abstraction — everything is still in your control, just faster and smoother.

What started as a hacky script to help me be a little lazier has now become an integral part of my workflow. I've already saved hours, and more importantly, my mental energy stays focused on solving real problems — not filling out repetitive forms. And when I shared it with others, they immediately got it. "Where was this last week?" one friend said. Exactly.

## Join the Journey

PR-bot is open-source, and I invite you to explore, use, and contribute to it. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, your insights can help refine and enhance the tool.
